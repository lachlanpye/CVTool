<content>Dear Recruiter,

Please accept this letter as an expression of my interest in the Javascript Developer position.

As a recent graduate from University of Auckland and having a history of experience in software development projects, I am the ideal candidate for this position. I have a detailed understanding of C#, Javascript, HTML and CSS, as well as a variety of other programming languages and best coding practices. I also have project development experience to back up my software skills, as the lead developer in a group of 5 to successfully develop and release the video game Into The Dark, which was created with Unity and coded in C#, as well as used Git as a project management tool.

I have years of work experience in hospitality roles which require communication and teamwork skills, giving me the ability to quickly pick up new skills and work within a team to deliver quality service. These skills give me the ability to quickly adapt to new scenarios, learn new skills and communicate effectively in a team, meaning I have the ideal soft skills to grow a wide technical skill set.

Please take a moment to review my attached resume and credentials. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak with you regarding my candidacy. I am based in Auckland, however I am able to relocate to Wellington as necessary.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Lachlan Pye</content>
